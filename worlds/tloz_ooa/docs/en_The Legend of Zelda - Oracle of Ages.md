# The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages 

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most acquirable pickups are shuffled among each other, following some logic to ensure the game ends up being completable.
This includes chests, keydrops, NPC items, trade sequence items, free standing item such as the heart container, and more.
This exclude Rare Maple drop, the Tokay Market, The Essences and the Maku Seed.

## What does another world's item look like in Oracle of Ages?

Items belonging to other worlds use an easily recognizable Archipelago sprite, which is blue if the item is unimportant, and red if it is a progression item. When collecting it, the game will inform you that you just sent an item to another player, and you can check on the client window to see which item was actually sent.
